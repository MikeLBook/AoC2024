## Advent of Code 2024

Writing the JS solutions in terminal only (tmux and neovim w/out an LSP). AoC is always a good excuse to branch out. 

Kotlin solutions are written in IntelliJ

Until the problems get more challenging, I'll probably solve them initially in JS/nvim.
Kotlin solutions are generally easier, but I'm more inclined to write alternative solutions for some
challenges, given Kotlin's support for multiple paradigms.
